A visualization of gravitational fields generated by bodies in a 2D space. The field lines are drawn by calculating the net gravitational force at each grid point, and the user can interactively change the resolution and magnitude of the field visualization and the sketch dynamically updates the field lines to reflect the influence of all bodies present.

Playing around with the parameters, you can get some interesting results, like the one below :)
