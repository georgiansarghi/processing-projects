Wiki: [Pythagoras tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_tree)

The Pythagoras tree fractal construction starts with a single square. At each iteration, two smaller squares are added to the sides of the previous square. The angle between the squares is usually $45^\circ$, but you can change it to get different shapes. I feel the gif below explains it better than I could with words :D

Fun fact: it is easy to prove that the area $A$ of the tree construscted with $45^\circ$ angles is finite, however the exact value is still unknown.
