Wiki: [Diffusion-limited aggregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation)

A simulation of a diffusion-limited aggregation process (DLA). The setup starts with a central particle and multiple smaller particles scattered randomly across the screen. The smaller particles move with Brownian motion, and if they collide with the big particle or with other "dead" particles, they become "dead" themselves and stop moving.
